PASSWORD STRENGTH


Passwords are essential for securing personal and sensitive information online. However, weak passwords can easily be compromised, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. This report evaluates the strength of various passwords using online password strength checkers. By analyzing different levels of complexity, we aim to understand the key factors that contribute to password security and highlight best practices for creating strong passwords.

Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Aim for length of at least 12 characters.

Avoid dictionary words or common patterns.

Use random combinations rather than predictable sequences.

Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords.


Common Password Attacks

Brute Force Attack: Trying every possible combination until the password is found.

Dictionary Attack: Using lists of common passwords or words to guess.

Credential Stuffing: Using leaked passwords from other breaches.

Social Engineering: Tricking users to reveal passwords.



How Password Complexity Affects Security


Increasing length exponentially increases the number of possible combinations.

Including symbols and mixed case greatly increases entropy.

Randomness reduces vulnerability to dictionary and pattern attacks.



Tips Learned from Evaluation


Password checkers sometimes underestimate 'real-world' risks â€” always prefer complexity and 
length.

Reusing passwords is dangerous even if strong.

Combine length and complexity for the best security.

Always use different passwords for different sites.
